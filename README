Ok, this is something funny that I wanted to code today after reading this post: http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2009/03/rspec-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck.html

Basically, this program will just play a burp sound every time that one of your ruby tests fail. Run the example file if you're curious [NSFW].

Note that the program uses the afplay command line tool, and it has only been tested on a mac.
